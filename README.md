# $MY(N)VIMRC
This repo is exclusively about my neovim config on Win10.

## Why?
Because on Win10 almost everything from *path* to *filename* is different from
that on GNU/Linux or macOS. For me, it is quite necessary to modify my nvim
config on \*nix to cater for my needs on Win10.

## Files/Dirs
- `init.d` contains modular configs of $MYVIMRC, including mappings,
  plugin-specific configs as well as other basic settings.
- `coc-settings.json` is the config for [coc.nivm](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim).
